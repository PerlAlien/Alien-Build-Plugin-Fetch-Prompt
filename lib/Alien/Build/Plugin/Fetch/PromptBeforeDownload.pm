=head1 SYNOPSIS

 % perldoc Alien::Build::Plugin::Fetch::Prompt

=head1 DESCRIPTION

When I first wrote L<Alien::Build::Plugin::Fetch::Prompt>, I gave it
this much too long a name.  It made my dist list on C<metacpan.org>
all kaka.  Sort of like that one episode of The Original Series
"For the World is Hollow and I have Touched the Sky" which is still
the longest episode title in the history of Star Trek.  (In case
you are wondering, and I can see you aren't, the second longest title
goes to the Deep Space 9 episode "Looking for par'Mach in All the
Wrong Places").  I bet by now you are realizing that you have wasted
a minute or two reading this documentation that you won't get back
again.
